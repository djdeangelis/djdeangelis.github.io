career-profile:
    title: Summary
    summary: |
      Seasoned product manager and technical writer with experience in the GRC, prototyping & 
      collaboration, and test & measurement spaces. As a product manager I've elicited stakeholder 
      requirements and transformed them into PRDs, user stories, UI mockups, and acceptance criteria. 
      As a technical writer I've created online help systems, UI help, API guides, training manuals, 
      video tutorials, and data sheets. Prior to my software career I worked in academia as a researcher 
      and instructor, and I've published several scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals.
